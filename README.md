# get-active-wordpress-users

These are programs for finding active and inactive users of your WordPress site. The programs export a CSV with that information into the same folder (the root).

The files should be installed in the root of your WordPress installation for them to be able to find the WordPress initiation file.

After you have run the program, download the files to your local computer and then FTP into your server and remove both these programs and the generated files.
